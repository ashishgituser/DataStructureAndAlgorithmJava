Singly Linked List
===========================

SLL is a linear data structure. Items in singly linked list are called nodes.
Each node contains data as well as location or reference to the next node.

Unlike array, linked list does not pre allocate memory.

We can add items to front, back and middle of the linked list as well as we can delete them.
